# Task Result

## React

I used the following technology / framework in my project:

- JavaScript / React


I chose React because of Develop Speed, bringing HTML code into JavaScript and working with virtual DOM

- Updates process is optimized and accelerated.
- JSX makes components/blocks code readable. It displays how components are plugged or combined with.
- React’s data binding establishes conditions for creating dynamic applications.
- Prompt rendering. Using comprises methods to minimize the number of DOM operations helps to optimize the updating process and accelerate it.

- Testable. React’s native tools are offered for testing, debugging code.
- SEO-friendly. React presents the first-load experience by server-side rendering and connecting event-handlers on the side of the user:
1. React.renderComponentToString is called on the server.
2. React.renderComponent() is called on the client-side.
3. React preserves markup rendered on the server-side, attaches event handlers.
- Up to date. The Facebook team supports the library. Advice or code samples can be given by the Facebook community.
- Using React+ES6/7, the application gets high-tech and is suitable for high-load systems.
